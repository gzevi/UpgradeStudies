============ HEADER FILE ==============

To make a new header file, just open a root file and run MakeClass():

root -l /home/gzevi/UpgradeSkims/BB-4p-300-700-v1510_14TEV_200PU_PhaseII_Substructure_PIX4022_1.root.root 
Delphes->MakeClass()

Unfortunately, in order to compile (??) you'll Need to replace "const" with "static const" for all the array delimiters.
Any way to get around it would be welcome...
For example, in Delphes.h, replace:
   const Int_t kMaxElectron = 6;
with:
   static const Int_t kMaxElectron = 6;

Also (clumsy, I know) the size of the arrays is determined based on the 1 file for which the MakeClass command was run.
So feel free to increase them if you suspect some samples will need larger arrays (any samples with more than 6 electrons?)

============ GETTING THE RIGHT CROSS-SECTIONS  ==============

Currently using this cross section file:
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/basilschneider/SUSY_Upgrade/master/config/configSkimmer.txt

With the current setup, the looper needs to run separately on each LT-bin of each sample, to get the cross-section right

##NOTE## The current setup doesn't automatically get the signal cross-section, I have a hack for that 
in do.sh, but when we have full scans we'll need a better setup. 


============ PLOTTING DETAILS =================

For each new folder (such as "Base" or "2Jets") that you want to produce in your root file,
remember that you need: (1) to make a <string, TH1> map, (2) to call fillHistos or plot1D using that map,
and (3) to call savePlotsDir() at the end of the loop to save that folder.
