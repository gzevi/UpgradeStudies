To make a new header file, just open a root file and run MakeClass():

root -l /home/gzevi/UpgradeSkims/BB-4p-300-700-v1510_14TEV_200PU_PhaseII_Substructure_PIX4022_1.root.root 
Delphes->MakeClass()

Need to replace const with static const for all the array delimiters!! Any way to get around it?

Currently using this cross section file:
